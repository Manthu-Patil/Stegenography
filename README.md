Steganography Project
Overview
Welcome to the Steganography Project â€“ an open-source initiative for hiding information within digital media. Steganography involves concealing data within other non-secret data to avoid detection. This project provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms to perform steganographic operations on various types of media files.

Features
Image Steganography: Embed secret messages within image files without compromising the visual quality.

Audio Steganography: Conceal information within audio files, enabling covert communication.

Text-based Embedding: Hide messages within text files using sophisticated algorithms for enhanced security.

Password Protection: Implement password-based protection for the concealed data to ensure authorized access.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly across different operating systems, promoting accessibility and ease of use.
